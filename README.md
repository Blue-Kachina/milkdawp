>>>>>>> # MilkDAWp

MilkDAWp is a JUCE-based VST3 audio plug-in with an OpenGL visualizer and optional projectM integration.

This README documents the working Windows setup (CLion + CMake + vcpkg) that produces a Cubase‑friendly, statically linked VST3 bundle.

## Highlights

- VST3 plugin built with JUCE 8
- C++20, CMake-based build
- Optional projectM v4 integration for visuals (auto-detected)
- Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Zero vendored third-party sources: dependencies are fetched/installed at configure time


Point CMake to the vcpkg toolchain file when configuring. For example (Windows):
```
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/vcpkg-master/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"

```

Adjust the path to where you installed vcpkg.

### 2) Configure and build (command line)

- Windows (MSVC, x64):
```
bash cmake -S . -B build ^ -A x64 ^ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/vcpkg-master/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" cmake --build build --config Release
```
=======

If you want the projectM visualizer, install `vcpkg` and the projectM v4 package:

- Windows (PowerShell):
    - `vcpkg install projectm4:x64-windows`
- macOS:
    - `vcpkg install projectm4`
- Linux:
    - `vcpkg install projectm4`

Point CMake to the vcpkg toolchain file when configuring. For example (Windows):
```
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/vcpkg-master/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"

```

Adjust the path to where you installed vcpkg.

### 2) Configure and build (command line)

- Windows (MSVC, x64):
```
bash cmake -S . -B build ^ -A x64 ^ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/vcpkg-master/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" cmake --build build --config Release
```

## Quick Start

### 1) Install vcpkg (for projectM)

If you want the projectM visualizer, install `vcpkg` and the projectM v4 package:

- Windows (PowerShell):
    - `vcpkg install projectm4:x64-windows`
- macOS:
    - `vcpkg install projectm4`
- Linux:
    - `vcpkg install projectm4`

Point CMake to the vcpkg toolchain file when configuring. For example (Windows):
```
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/vcpkg-master/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"

```

Adjust the path to where you installed vcpkg.

### 2) Configure and build (command line)

- Windows (MSVC, x64):
```
bash cmake -S . -B build ^ -A x64 ^ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/vcpkg-master/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" cmake --build build --config Release
```

- macOS:
```
bash cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$HOME/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" cmake --build build --config Release

```

- Linux:
```
bash cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="$HOME/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" cmake --build build --config Release

```

If you omit the toolchain file, the build still succeeds but will disable projectM (fallback renderer).

### 3) Configure in CLion

- Open: Settings (or Preferences on macOS) → Build, Execution, Deployment → CMake
- In “CMake options” add (example path shown for Windows):
  ```
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/vcpkg-master/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
  ```
- Apply, then “Reload CMake Project”.

## How dependencies are resolved

- JUCE
    - Declared with `FetchContent` in CMake and fetched at configure time.
    - Lives under your build directory (e.g. `build/_deps/juce-src`), not in the repo.
- projectM v4 (optional)
    - Found via `find_package(projectM4 QUIET)`.
    - When found, the build links `libprojectM::projectM` and defines `HAVE_PROJECTM` for conditional compilation.
    - If not found, the build continues without projectM and uses the fallback renderer.

During configure, you’ll see either:
- “Found projectM4 via find_package(projectM4)” (projectM enabled), or
- “projectM4 not found; building WITHOUT projectM (fallback renderer only)”.

---

## Outputs and deployment

- Build targets include the VST3: `MilkDAWp_VST3` (format-specific target generated by JUCE).
- On Windows, post-build steps copy `resources/presets` into the VST3 bundle under `Contents/Resources/presets`.

### Optional developer deploy (Windows)

There is a convenience target to copy the built plugin into the system VST3 folder:

- Option: `MILKDAWP_DEV_DEPLOY` (OFF by default)
- Manual target: `deploy_vst3`

To deploy manually:
```
bash cmake --build build --config Release --target deploy_vst3
```

To auto-deploy after each VST3 build (requires Administrator privileges), configure with:
```
-DMILKDAWP_DEV_DEPLOY=ON
```

This copies the built bundle into `%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%/VST3/MilkDAWp.vst3`.

## Development notes

- Language standard: C++20
- CMake minimum: 3.16
- JUCE splash, web browser, and CURL are disabled for smaller footprint.
- The visualizer supports two modes:
    - projectM mode (when `HAVE_PROJECTM` is defined because `projectM4` was found)
    - Fallback OpenGL mode (simple quad rendering) when projectM isn’t present

### Presets

- At build time on Windows, presets are copied into the VST3 bundle under `Contents/Resources/presets`.
- You can add or update preset files in `resources/presets/` and they will be staged accordingly.



JUCE sources are fetched into your build directory under `_deps/` at configure time.

- A simple file logger writes logs to the user’s application data directory, under `MilkDAWp/logs/`.
- Use the `MDW_LOG` macro in code to write tagged log lines.


## Troubleshooting

- “projectM4 not found; building WITHOUT projectM …”
    - Ensure you installed `projectm4` via vcpkg (or system package manager).
    - Make sure CMake is told to use the vcpkg toolchain file.
    - Clear your CMake cache if switching between toolchains and re-configure.

- “64-bit build required. Configure with -A x64.”
    - On Windows/MSVC, add `-A x64` to CMake configure or select the x64 generator in your IDE.

- VST3 not picked up by your DAW
    - On Windows, ensure the bundle is deployed to `%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%/VST3`.
    - Some hosts cache plug-ins; you may need to rescan or restart the host.

- OpenGL issues
    - Make sure your GPU drivers are up to date.
    - Headless/remote sessions may not provide hardware GL; use a local session.
